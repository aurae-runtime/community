# What is Aurae? 

[Aurae](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae) is an opinionated turing complete scripting language built for the enterprise. Think of it like TypeScript for infrastructure platforms.

[Auraed](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/auraed) is the project core runtime daemon, auth and identity management system, and gRPC server that listens on a Unix domain socket.
