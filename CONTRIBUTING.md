## Filing issues

- We exclusively use Github Issues for issue tracking.
- Make a brief search through existing issues to prevent the filing of
  duplicated issues.
- The issue should describe:
  1. Steps to reproduce.
  2. Expected behavior.
  3. Experienced behavior.

## Creating Pull Requests

- Make sure that the Pull Request is based on the most recent commit of `main`.
- Make sure that the code is formatted according the default settings of
  `rustfmt` for Rust, otherwise adhere to the existing coding style.
- Run the test suite locally before submitting the Pull Request.
- Use force-push to your branch if you have to update a Pull Request to override
  old commits.

## Review process

Reviews are common practices and ideally each change should be reviewed before
it's merged.

A review resulting in comments should be submitted using `Request changes` to
ensure that each comment gets handled explicitly.
