# Code of Conduct

The code of conduct calls out the immediate rules of engagement, and general operation expectations while contributing to the project.

### "Don't be a Dick" Policy

The Aurae project and its surrounding community have found safety and value in a primary governing policy, that is often hard to interpret. 

 - Don't be a dick.

This is a guiding principal for the project. We expect everyone to be treated with dignity and respect and more importantly we believe that if you are wondering if you are acting inappropriately -- you know you are. However you personally define "being a dick" is what we mean. 

Don't be it. You know if you are. You should stop.
